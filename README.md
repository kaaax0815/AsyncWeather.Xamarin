# AsyncWeather.Xamarin

C# Asnyc Weather App written in Xamarin.Android

App unfortunately skips frames because of [TextView](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31139138/how-to-avoid-lag-when-displaying-a-large-string). WebView would be an alternative, but then I had the make it completely new in HTML and the Problem with the Horizontal Scrollbar is weird
